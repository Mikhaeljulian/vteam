title: 'Hello world: how I built this site'
abstract: I originally built this portfolio site back in 2018, and since then it's evolved quite a bit. Recently I migrated from Create React App to Next.js and made some major upgrades in the process.

## How it all started

Back in 2021 we needed to update our portfolio site (as designers are wont to do). We thought steer away from current trends and build a site that tapped into the 80s and 90s Cyberpunk aesthetic. The genre contains some of our favorite movies like Ghost in the Shell (1995), The Matrix (1999), and Akira (1988). That's where I borrowed few visual motifs like the bold katakana lettering on the homepage and the text decoding effect as a homage to the Matrix's "Digital rain" effect, which was itself inspired by Ghost in the Shell's opening credits. There's even a nod to Ghost in the Shell on my [404 page](/404).

## The first iteration

We was learning React when we first built this website, and while overkill for a personal portfolio site, it was a great opportunity to learn and experiment with learning it. we've found the best way to learn is by actually making something that you intend to use and ship.

The no-brainer choice at the time was Create React App. It served us well in getting things up and running without having to fuss about with config. On top of that, We was using Styled Components, Tween.js, and React Transition Group. We was also playing with some early Three.js effects like the displacement sphere that still resides on the homepage.

Since then we've used this website as a playground for experimenting with new tech and techniques, so over time I've overhauled pretty much everything. A big change along the way was replacing images of our work in static mockups with real-time rendered interactive 3D .

## Migrating to Next.js

With Create React App we was using a somewhat janky and unmaintained package to prerender the site as static HTML in Puppeteer. This worked okay for the most part, but we wanted a more robust solution for posting articles (like this one you're reading) using MDX. I had a half baked version of this lying dormant in the repo, but it never felt good enough to publish. We looked at a few options like Gatsby, Vite, and Parcel, and Remix, but Next.js stood out as the most suited to our needs.

- The site is now based on Next.js. Is a much better fit than Create React App. For now We're just using it to create a static export, but maybe we'll add some server rendered stuff in the future.
- Styling is now vanilla CSS with postcss to add support for the future native CSS nesting and custom media queries features. We're using CSS modules instead of BEM syntax to avoid style conflicts.
- For generating pages from `.mdx` files, I'm using Kent C Dodds' [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler). In combination with Next.js it makes generating pages from `.mdx` files really quick and simple.
- For animation we've moved from Tween.js and React Transition Group to just Framer Motion.
- 3D effects are still all using Three.js, but We've added `three-stdlib` as a better maintained replacement for modules from Three's examples.

## Not all smooth sailing

For the most part, the migration was pretty straight-forward. The way We has structured the site with React Router lent itself well to conforming with Next.js's file-based routing, and We was already using postcss for styling. We did, however, encounter a couple of problems:

### 1. Route transitions

There was a bit of a conflict when it came to animated route transitions. Next.js will immediately yank out all of the styles for the previous page when navigating to a new one. This works great when you're not animating between pages because it cleans up any unused styles form hanging around. When you are animating the page transition though, all of a sudden the previous page becomes jarringly completely unstyled as it transitions out. This problem one of [the most commented and reacted to issues](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/17464) on the Next.js repo, so hopefully there's a fix soon, but for now We've dropped in a [hack to fix things](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/17464#issuecomment-796430107) from the issue's comments.

### 2. Scroll restoration

Somewhat related to the route transitions, We had to opt out of both Next.js's and the native browser's scroll restoration in order to prevent the browser immediately scrolling to the top when the page started transitioning out. Next.js also doesn't appear to handle shifting focus when linking to the id of an element within the page, so we added that in for accessibility.
